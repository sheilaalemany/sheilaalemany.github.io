    "description": "In Fall of 2017, I was the Artificial Intelligence Project Lead for Upsilon Pi Epsilon's SparkDev program. The project consisted of predicting the trajectory paths of hurricanes using a recurrent neural network (RNN). I lead a group of six students to complete this project in nine weeks using Python and Keras API.</p><p>Upon completion of the project, I decided to pursue this as an independent research project. With the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence and the sporadic behavior of hurricane trajectories, we utilized a fine grid along with a recurrent neural network to learn the nonlinear response of hurricane trajectories. As first author, I was able to present at a seminar for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (NHC). Following positive feedback from the NOAA scientists, we successfully published <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02548'>\"Predicting Hurricane Trajectories using a Recurrent Neural Network\"</a> to the <a href='https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/'>2019 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)</a> conference under the applied artificial intelligence track to introduce deep learning as a way to enhance the environmental forecasting techniques employed by NHC for more accurate predictions.",

Once there, I conducted exploratory data analysis to assist in the process of improving machine learning approaches that predict cyber-attacks. Under the mentorship of the technical staff Dr. Joseph Zipkin, Dr. Amy Hughes, and Evan Young, I was able to contribute to the existing set of metrics by proposing new evaluation techniques that use statistical methods, natural language processing, and clustering techniques. This experience provided more inspiration and reassurance of the importance of impactful research.",

    "description": "Under the mentorship of Dr. Pissinou, a PhD student and I have developed a method for mobile wireless sensor networks and the expanding field of Internet of Things that predicts future data streams using the abstracted behavior of historical data. This method uses a candlestick data structure, commonly used in currency market analysis, to partition the data. It also uses dynamic time warping as a similarity metric, and a support vector machine for trend prediction. My contribution involved developing these aforementioned techniques. I after which completed their implementation and simulated them using Python. Our techniques can improve the space complexity of the data collected in mobile wireless sensor networks without losing any behavioral information about the data.</p><p>As the data collected in the field expands, our algorithms could allow for extended sensor durability in mobile wireless sensor networks. Lengthened sensor endurance will facilitate many applications that require minimal human interference to improve, such as environmental and health monitoring. The work has been successfully published as a workshop paper in the <a href='https://workshop.euranova.eu/bigdata18.html'>2018 Third Workshop on Real-time + Stream Analytics in Big Data + Stream Data Management</a> called \"Using Candlestick Charting and Dynamic Time Warping for Data Behavior Modeling and Trend Prediction for MWSN in IoT\".

This was done by separating each individual instrument and training one neural network per instrument and then stitching the musical tracks back together. This fun and entertaining project won Best Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Hack and we were able to gain more experience in neural networks along with some knowledge on music theory.",

    "description": "My work in dynamic trust establishment for mobile wireless sensor networks began in the fall of 2016 under the mentorship of Dr. Niki Pissinou in the Army Educational Outreach Program at Florida International Univerisity (FIU). Under that program. I was able to implemented and simulated a lightweight technique for data cleaning in mobile wireless sensor networks that used an economic model for determining the trustworthiness of candidate sensors to improve data accuracy. This work, called <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8390320'>\"Context-Aware Data Cleaning for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: A Diversified Trust Approach\"</a>, was successfully published in <i><a href='http://www.conf-icnc.org/2018/'>2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)</a></i>.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, still with Dr. Pissinou, I participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates at FIU in the summer of 2017. During that time I collaborated in two projects. One consisted of improving upon the work done as a Research Assistant for the Army Educational Outreach Program, including making the method more robust with less user-defined parameters. This work, called <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8455888'>\"A Dynamic Trust Weight Allocation Technique for Data Reconstruction in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks\"</a>, was successfully published in <i><a href='http://www.cloud-conf.net/trustcom18/'>2018 International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications (TrustCom)</a></i>. The second project formally applying category theory to data cleaning for mobile wireless sensor networks by finding ways the decision-making method would benefit from categorically organizing the data each sensor receives. All of these projects were simulated using MATLAB and the BonnMotion Mobility Generation and Analysis Tool and tested using an environmental dataset.",

I was able to learn this using Python and Tensorflow through five main projects.</p><br><h6>Project 1</h6><p>In this project, I built a simple neural network from scratch that predicts bike sharing rides for a bike shop, or how many bikes the bike shop may need based on the amount of expected customers in a certain month. This project allowed me to use the concepts learned up to this point, such as gradient descent and backpropagation.</p><br><h6>Project 2</h6><p>In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. I used a convolutional neural network to classify images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. This project allowed me to learn about convolutional neural networks, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.</p><br><h6>Project 3</h6><p>In this project, I generated Simpsons TV scripts using a recurrent neural network using a dataset that contained the scripts from 27 seasons of the Simpsons. This project allowed me to learn about recurrent neural networks using LSTM cells.</p><br><h6>Project 4</h6><p>In this project, I translated sentences from English to French using a sequence to sequence recurrent neural network. The model was trained on English to French. Project 3 and 4 allowed me to practice text preprocessing including methods to encode, decode, tokenize, and pad.</p><br><h6>Project 5</h6><p>In this project, I generated images of human faces using a generative adversarial neural network. The model was trained using two datasets, MNIST and CelebA. The MNIST dataset is used to first to train and test the model as it is a simple dataset containing handwritten digits. The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. This project allowed me to learn about generative adversarial neural networks containing a discriminator neural network and generator.",
